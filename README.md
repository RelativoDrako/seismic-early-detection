An **applied AI research project** focused on **early seismic signal detection and impact estimation** under **real-world operational constraints**.

This repository is designed to demonstrate:

- System-level thinking  
- Applied machine learning in safety-critical contexts  
- Edge-first architectural decisions  
- Robustness over raw accuracy  

---

## 🎯 Problem Context

Seismic early warning systems must operate under severe constraints:

- Very limited early signal windows  
- Noisy and incomplete data  
- High cost of false positives  
- Strict latency requirements  
- Unreliable network connectivity  

Many ML prototypes ignore these realities.

**This project explicitly models them.**

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

> *In safety-critical systems, an approximate early decision is often more valuable than a perfect late one.*

Core principles:

- Edge-first inference  
- Low-latency pipelines  
- Failure awareness  
- Confidence-based decisions  
- Human-override capability  

---

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

End-to-end pipeline:

1. Seismic signal generation (simulated)  
2. Signal preprocessing and feature extraction  
3. Lightweight baseline ML models  
4. Confidence-aware decision logic  
5. Evaluation under noise and failure scenarios  

Architecture diagrams and design decisions are documented in:

- `/architecture`  
- `/decisions`

## ⚙️ Prerequisites
Windows 10 / 11

Python 3.10 or newer

PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+

Git (optional, recommended)

## Verify Python installation(Powershell):
```bash
python --version
```
## 🚀 Quick Start

1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RelativoDrako/seismic-early-detection.git
cd seismic-early-detection
```
2️⃣ Allow local PowerShell scripts (one-time setup)
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
3️⃣ Initialize the project
```powershell
.\setup_seismic.ps1
```

## This script will:

Create the folder structure

Generate base configuration files

Create a Python virtual environment

Install all required dependencies

4️⃣ Run the full pipeline
```powershell
.\deploy_seismic.ps1
```

## 📊 Evaluation Focus
Models are evaluated based on:

Detection latency

Robustness to noise

False positive impact

Behavior under partial system failures

Accuracy alone is not the primary metric.

---

## 🌍 Potential Applications
Seismic early warning research

Infrastructure protection systems

Industrial vibration anomaly detection

Edge-based risk assessment platforms

---

## 🚧 Project Status
Active research and iterative development.

Planned future work:

Integration of real seismic datasets

Edge device profiling and benchmarking

Lightweight CNN-based models

Uncertainty quantification and confidence calibration
