# Baseline Models

Baseline models are intentionally simple and interpretable.

## Implemented

- Threshold-based detection
- Logistic Regression

## Rationale

Before introducing complex neural architectures, the project establishes:
- performance lower bounds
- operational stability
- explainability of decisions

These models serve as reference points for future experimental approaches.
